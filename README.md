# Description
### This project is a simplified front end clone of Netflix with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Authentication. It was created with React and CSS. It uses The [MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to search for movies and display details. It is not finished, I'm still working on it.
